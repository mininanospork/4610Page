			Reading the CRS Report - <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46999">Immigration: Apprehensions and Expulsions at the Southwest Border December 22, 2021</a>, demonstrates the strength of this service. The report highlights much great information about this complex area of policy and human events, by visualizing data and marshalling relevant policy actions to bring clear and accurate insight to the reader.
		</p>
		<p> 
			In 2nd paragraph of the Summary Page, CRS zooms in onthe increase in migration from the Northern Triangle Countries (El Salvador, Guatamala, and Hondorus) 
		</p>
		<div class="blockquote">
			"The past decade has also seen a shift to many more migrants coming from the Northern Triangle countries (El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras)."
		</div>
		<p>
			This is re-highlighted in the Introduction, but this time with footnote 6, which contains a summary of <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/03/16/statement-homeland-security-secretary-alejandro-n-mayorkas-regarding-situation" title="Statement by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas Regarding the Situation at the Southwest Border | Homeland Security">Secretary Mayorkas Statement from March 15, 2021</a>.
		</p>
		<div class="blockquote">
			"DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas maintains that increasing levels of violence, corruption, poverty, and deteriorating political, economic, and environmental conditions are key motivations for migration to the United States from Mexico and Central America"
		</div>
		<p>
			Then in Figure 4 We can see the huge jump in Single Adult encounters (highlighted in a shade of Cashmere (pink peach-ish)) and in Figure 5 in Family units in the same color (note the similar jump in 2019 and relative dominance of Northern Triangle families previously), and again tragically in Figure 6 for unaccompanied children with same highligh color and same bar chart cover.

			This data really tells the reader something is very wrong in the Northern Triangle areas, bringing this to Secretary Mayorkas attention almost immediately after assuming office.
		</p>
		<p>
			What has the Biden Administration done about this? Mayaorkas likely brough this to the attention of the cabinent, where by the Vice President took point to dramatically improce the situation on the ground for folks in Northern Triangle Coiuntries.
		</p>
		<p>
			By May the Vice President made a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/27/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-launches-a-call-to-action-to-the-private-sector-to-deepen-investment-in-the-northern-triangle/" title="FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Launches a Call to Action to the Private Sector to Deepen Investment in the Northern Triangle | The White House">Call to Action</a> across both the public and private sector focusing on these key actions:
			<ul>
				<li><div class="agenda">Reform Agenda</div>- Commitments to support greater transparency, predictability, and stability in the business enabling environment by facilitating regional government efforts to adopt international best practices in licensing, permitting, procurement, regulation, and taxation.
				</li>
    			<li><div class="agenda">Digital and Financial Inclusion</div> - Commitments to expand affordable internet access and participation in the digital economy; facilitate access to financial technologies and capital for small businesses, particularly women- and indigenous-owned businesses; and ensure that the most vulnerable and the most likely to migrate have access to basic public services and financial institutions.
    			</li>
    			<li><div class="agenda">Food Security and Climate-smart Agriculture</div> – Commitments to combat food shortages by increasing agricultural productivity and crop resilience.
    			</li>
    			<li><div class="agenda">Climate Adaptation and Clean Energy</div> – Commitments to support the region’s resilience to climate change through adaptation and mitigation efforts; support industries impacted by climate change; and transition to clean energy.
    			</li>
    			<li><div class="agenda">Education and Workforce Development</div> – Commitments to expand job-training programs; support greater access to technical and secondary education; and create higher paying formal sector jobs, especially for women and in rural areas.
    			</li>
    			<li><div class="agenda">Public Health Access</div> – Commitments to support regional governments in addressing the impact of COVID-19 on their populations; build robust and resilient health economies to confront future health challenges; support access to clean water and sanitation; and ensure inclusive access to healthcare.
    			</li>
    		</ul>
    	</p>
    	<p>
			The Vice-President working with the State Department developed a new Public Private Non-Profit Partnership Organization, <a href="https://www.centampartnership.org/">Partnership For Central America</a> to coordinate organizations and people. Which lead to a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/13/politics/kamala-harris-private-sector-investments-north-triangle/index.html" title="Harris to announce new private sector investments in Northern Triangle | CNN Politics">$1.2B commitment</a> by December of 2021, the same month as the report- increasing in size to by $1.9B to <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/harris-touts-3-2-billion-investment-aimed-at-stemming-central-america-migration-/6607331.html" title="Harris Touts $3.2 Billion Investment Aimed at Stemming Central America Migration">$3.2B, six months later, bringing jobs, commerce and other permanent growth improvements to the region.
		</p>
		<p>
			But what about the violence and corruption endemic to the Northern Triangle area? DoJ moved slower and more powerfully, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-anticorruption-task-force-launches-new-measures-combat-corruption-central" title="Justice Department Anticorruption Task Force Launches New Measures to Combat Corruption in Central America | OPA | Department of Justice">announcing a new task force in October of 2021. </a> Which has delevered many arrests and prosecutions over the same time period. Most recently <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/three-highest-ranking-ms-13-leaders-world-arrested-terrorism-and-racketeering-charges" title="Eastern District of New York | Three of the Highest-Ranking MS-13 Leaders in the World Arrested on Terrorism and Racketeering Charges | United States Department of Justice">crippling the leadership of El Salvador's notorius MS-13.</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			And what of the measurable effects of this work? We can see via <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47343">the followup fact sheet for FY2022</a> in figure 4- despite dramatic increases in historically Atypical Countries of origin for Migrants, the Northern Triangle Migrant numbers are already falling.

			Good information presented well helps the public dive into and understand even very specific aspects of very complicated problems.
